                <cmd>Start with a quality shot.</cmd>
                <info>
                    <p>The ultimate shortcut to crafting a great Instagram post is to begin with a
                        quality photo. Try shooting in natural light, and take a bunch of shots.
                        That way you have choices.</p>

                <info>
                    <p>Filters are like ice cream flavors: tastes vary by person, but some are more
                        popular than others. And when it comes to figuring out your own preferences,
                        the tried-and-true method is to sample widely.<image

                <cmd>Adjust the Lux setting by clicking on the sun icon above your photo.</cmd>
                <info>
                    <p>Lux adjusts the contrast and exposure of photos, adding dimension and making
                        the features of the photo pop. Itâ€™s sort of like contour, but for your
                        pictures instead of your face. This can be particularly helpful for
                        enhancing underexposed photos.<image
